# LDCI_MatlabUPC
This GitHub repo contains most of the code used to train a NLMPC and SAC algorithms in Matlab Simulink using a model with a neural network. This neural network simulates a HEV and from a series of inputs obtains the NOx emissions (NO, NO2), the State
of Charge of the battery (SoC) and the shaft_torque. The main folders are:
